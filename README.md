## Introduction

The **Image Classification and Object Detection System** is an intelligent solution that leverages deep learning techniques to classify image content and detect multiple objects in real-time. It has wide applicability across various domains such as surveillance, healthcare, retail, and autonomous vehicles. The system is designed to deliver high accuracy and efficiency, making it suitable for real-world deployment.

---

## System Overview

The system performs two primary functions:

- **Image Classification**: Assigns a label to an image based on its visual content.
- **Object Detection**: Identifies and localizes multiple objects within an image using bounding boxes.

The pipeline includes modules for preprocessing, model training, inference, and a user-facing graphical interface.

---

## Objectives

- Develop a robust system for image classification and object detection.
- Utilize transfer learning with pre-trained deep learning models.
- Design an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) for user interaction.
- Enable real-time predictions through efficient deployment.

## System Architecture

1. **Input Layer**: Accepts uploaded image files from users.
2. **Preprocessing Module**: Resizes and normalizes input images for consistency.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract key features.
4. **Classification / Detection Heads**:
   - **Classification Head**: Outputs a class label.
   - **Detection Head**: Outputs object classes and bounding box coordinates.
5. **Output Layer**: Displays classification results or annotated images with bounding boxes.
