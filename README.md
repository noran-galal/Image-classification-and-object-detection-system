Introduction
The Image Classification and Object Detection System is designed to analyze images and identify objects within them. This project involves building a robust AI system that uses deep learning models to classify images and detect multiple objects in real time. It is useful in a wide range of applications including surveillance, medical diagnostics, autonomous driving, and more.

System Overview
This system performs two primary tasks:

Image Classification: Assigning labels to images based on their content.

Object Detection: Identifying and localizing objects within an image using bounding boxes.

The architecture includes data preprocessing, model training, inference, and user interaction through a graphical interface.

Objectives
Develop a deep learning-based system for image classification and object detection.

Use transfer learning to improve performance with pre-trained models.

Implement a user-friendly GUI for image uploads and result display.

Enable deployment for real-time inference on new images.

System Architecture
Input Layer: Accepts images from the user.

Preprocessing Module: Resizes and normalizes the images.

Feature Extraction: Uses CNN-based models to extract image features.

Classification/Detection Head:

For classification, outputs a class label.

For detection, returns object classes with bounding boxes.

Output Layer: Displays classification label or detection results to the user.

Functional Requirements
Upload image via GUI.

Perform classification and display label.

Perform object detection and draw bounding boxes.

Display inference results clearly to the user.

Non-Functional Requirements
High accuracy and precision in classification and detection.

Real-time inference.

Intuitive and responsive user interface.

Scalable and modular code structure.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python

Deep Learning Libraries: TensorFlow / Keras / PyTorch

Object Detection Models: YOLO, Faster R-CNN

GUI Framework: Tkinter / PyQt

IDE: Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

Version Control: Git, GitHub

Dataset
Public datasets such as ImageNet, COCO, or Pascal VOC were used for training.

Images were labeled and preprocessed to fit the input requirements of the models.

Model Training
Transfer learning applied on pre-trained models (e.g., ResNet, YOLOv5).

Fine-tuning performed with labeled data.

Models trained using GPU acceleration for faster convergence.

Loss functions:

Classification: Cross-entropy loss

Detection: IoU, classification loss, and bounding box regression loss

Model Evaluation
Metrics used:

Accuracy (for classification)

Precision, Recall, F1 Score

mAP (mean Average Precision) for detection

Confusion matrices and ROC curves plotted for better analysis.

Object Detection
Implemented YOLOv5 and/or Faster R-CNN for high-speed and accurate detection.

Bounding boxes drawn on detected objects with class labels and confidence scores.

Real-time performance tested with webcam input.

User Interface
A simple GUI allows users to:

Upload images

View classification results

View detected objects with bounding boxes

Real-time feedback provided immediately after image input.

Deployment
Application can be deployed as a:

Standalone executable (via PyInstaller)

Web app (via Flask or Streamlit)

Can be run locally or hosted on cloud platforms (e.g., Heroku, AWS)

Future Work
Support for video input and real-time object tracking.

Integration with cloud storage for dataset scalability.

Mobile deployment using TensorFlow Lite or ONNX.

Improve model accuracy through hyperparameter tuning and data augmentation.
